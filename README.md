# Stock Analysis

## 1.1 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to assist our investment firm in identifying high-potential indexes for short-term investment. By analyzing historical stock data and forecasting future returns, we aim to determine which indexes are most likely to yield favorable returns within a specified period. Additionally, we will assess the associated risks and volatilities of these indexes to guide a balanced investment decision. Our final deliverables include forecasted returns, volatility insights, and strategic recommendations for index fund selection.

## 1.2 Problem Statement (Motivation)

Index funds offer a diversified, cost-effective way to gain exposure to market segments, making them an attractive option for institutional investors. However, selecting the right index requires a balance between potential returns and risk tolerance. This project focuses on providing short-term forecasts for several indexes, along with a comprehensive risk assessment, allowing our firm to capitalize on promising market trends while maintaining prudent risk management. By presenting these findings in an accessible format, we aim to support informed decision-making across the firm.

## 1.3 Project Structure

This project is structured as follows:

1. Data Exploration: We will examine historical performance metrics of the indexes to identify promising candidates.
2. Forecasting: Using time series forecasting, we’ll project short-term returns for selected indexes, allowing us to gauge expected performance.
3. Risk Analysis: We’ll evaluate the historical volatility of each index to provide insights into the associated risks, helping the firm balance return potential with risk.
4. Conclusion and Recommendations: Our final report will synthesize these insights into actionable recommendations for index fund investment.
